# Buggy-cars-website-automated-API-testing

In this project, I worked on testing and ensuring the quality of the APIs for the Buggy Cars website, a platform for browsing and purchasing used cars where you can also practice your testing knowledge. Using Postman, I analyzed the web responses received from the website's various API endpoints, which were primarily in JSON format. These responses contained critical information related to car listings, user accounts, and transaction processes, among other features.

To validate the functionality and reliability of each API, I implemented automated test scripts in JavaScript within Postman. These scripts were designed to test multiple aspects of the APIs, including:

    Response Status Codes: Ensuring that the correct HTTP status codes were returned for different API requests (e.g., 200 OK for successful requests, 404 for non-existent endpoints, etc.).
    Data Integrity: Verifying that the API responses returned accurate and consistent data, such as valid car details, pricing, and availability.
    Response Time: Checking if the API endpoints responded within an acceptable timeframe to maintain a good user experience.
    Data Structure Validation: Ensuring that the responses adhered to the expected JSON schema, with all necessary fields being present and correctly formatted.

The automated testing helped to reduce manual testing efforts, enabling faster feedback on potential bugs or issues with the API. By running these tests regularly, I ensured that the Buggy Cars website's APIs consistently met the required standards for functionality, security, and performance, which contributed to a smoother user experience for car buyers and sellers.
